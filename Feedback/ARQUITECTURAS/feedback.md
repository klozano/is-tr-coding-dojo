Interesting talk about about monolithic and microservices architecture

The conecpts shown in this meeting where famliar to me thanks to a previos class i had in the university with Mauricio Terceros, so it was more of a refresh, but when the time came to implement the metods in a small API by ourselves we stumbled upon a wall of basic structure creation and element initialization with my partner, so i may know what it is supposed to do and how, but i still struggle actually doing it, in the end it was an interesting excersise.
